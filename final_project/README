3 viewing modes: 
  1. Orbit around origin
    left arrow    decrease azimuth
    right arrow   increase azimuth
    up arrow      increase angle of elevation
    down arrow    decrease angle of elevation
  2. First person grounded
    left arrow    strafe left
    right arrow   strafe right
    up arrow      move forward
    down arrow    move backward
    mouse         point camera
  3. First person flight
    left arrow    strafe left
    right arrow   strafe right
    up arrow      move forward
    down arrow    move backward
    Page up       increase elevation
    Page down     decrease elevation
    mouse         point camera

  v/v        cycle through viewing modes (origin orbit, fps grounded, fps flight) 
  a/A        decrease/increase ambient light
  s/S        decrease/increase speculat light
  d/D        decrease/increase diffused light     
  m/m        Toggle light movement
  x/X        Toggle axes
  z/Z        Toggle shadow Map
  n/n        Toggle normals
  f/F        decrease/increaser FOV
  0          Reset view angle
  ESC        Exit


It Doesn't look like much. I got too caught up trying to do shaders and all the hard stuff
and didn't allocate enough time for building an interesting world.

However, there are some highlights.

Everything is build using Vertex array objects and shaders instead of the native OpenGl pipeline. 
The first thing I implemented was the geometry shader that displays all the normals. Press n to toggle this feature.
Next I built a shadow mapping shader. You can view the actual map by clicking z. Somehow in the last 24 hours I messed up the lighting 
directions so they dont alwasy point the right way but when you are in the origin orbit view mode(0) and the light mode (0)
you cab really see it in action. 

I implememnted fog myself inside a shader and faded it into the skybox which itself fades thorugh an accelerated full day cycle. 
I also chose to rotate the skybox to give the clouds a blowing effect. Unfortunetly, it also looks like the wind is blowing te stars aswell
the "sun" light  when in mode 1 follows the day and night cycles and centers around the player like the sky box so it always feels like
the sun is far away and directly overhead.

I also built individual View matrices, model matrices and material functions to give me more flexibility when building my final project.
Unforunately I spent more time "setting up" to make it than actually making it.
